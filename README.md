# ðŸŒŠ Underwater-Image-Enhancement

### ðŸ“– **Introduction**: 
Images captured underwater are frequently degraded by environmental conditions and limitations of camera gear. Common issues include reduced visibility, low brightness, low contrast, noise and strong color shifts. While many techniques have been explored over the past few decades, challenges remain in achieving consistent, natural enhancement across diverse underwater scenes. Building on what works and where prior methods fall short, this project proposes a practical enhancement pipeline focused on effective pre-processing: improving contrast and brightness, denoising and recovering texture detail. The approach addresses overand under brightness problems, restores fine structures and produces more balanced colors resulting in a robust improvement to underwater image clarity and overall visual quality.

### ðŸ“¸ **Impact**:
Clearer, brighter, more natural underwater photos revealing hidden details for research, inspection and storytelling.

### ðŸ“‚ **Dataset Details**: 
- **Total Images**: **1696** photos. <br>
- **Format**: All images are in **.jpg** format to maintain uniformity.
- **Resolution**: All images are uniformly resized to **256 Ã— 256 pixels**.
