# Underwater-Image-Enhancement
ðŸŒŠ Underwater Images often look Hazy, Dark, Noisy and Unnaturally Tinted because water absorbs and scatters light. This project improves the quality of such images by boosting visibility, balancing brightness and contrast, reducing noise and restoring fine details for clear and natural-looking results.
